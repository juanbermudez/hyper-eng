# Web App Debugger Customization
# This agent debugs web applications using Claude Code Chrome extension.
# Customize how browser debugging is performed for your project.

# Add project-specific context for debugging
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - App runs on localhost:3000 (Next.js dev server)
  # - We use React DevTools for component inspection
  # - Redux DevTools for state debugging
  # - Network requests go to localhost:8080 (API server)
  # - Authentication uses cookies, not localStorage

# Instructions added BEFORE the default debugging instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # Before debugging, ensure:
  # 1. Both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8080) servers are running
  # 2. The user is logged in with test credentials if testing authenticated flows
  # 3. Browser cache is cleared for CSS/JS issues

# Instructions added AFTER the default debugging instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # After debugging:
  # 1. Document any browser-specific issues found
  # 2. Note if the issue is related to browser extensions
  # 3. Check if issue reproduces in incognito mode

# Development server configuration
dev_server:
  # Frontend URL
  frontend_url: "http://localhost:3000"
  # API URL (if separate)
  api_url: "http://localhost:8080"
  # Start command (if agent should start the server)
  start_command: "npm run dev"
  # Health check endpoint
  health_check: "/api/health"

# Browser configuration
browser:
  # Preferred browser for testing
  preferred: "chrome"
  # Viewport sizes to test
  viewports:
    - name: "mobile"
      width: 375
      height: 667
    - name: "tablet"
      width: 768
      height: 1024
    - name: "desktop"
      width: 1440
      height: 900

# Common debugging scenarios
debugging_scenarios:
  # Example:
  # - name: "Authentication flow"
  #   pages: ["/login", "/dashboard"]
  #   checks: ["cookie set", "redirect works", "session persists"]
  # - name: "Form submission"
  #   pages: ["/contact", "/checkout"]
  #   checks: ["validation works", "success message shows", "data persists"]

# Console error patterns to ignore
ignore_console_errors:
  # Example:
  # - "Third-party cookie"           # Known browser warning
  # - "DevTools failed to load"      # Extension noise
  # - "Manifest: Line"               # Extension manifest warnings

# Network requests to ignore in analysis
ignore_network_patterns:
  # Example:
  # - "*.hotjar.com"
  # - "*.google-analytics.com"
  # - "*.sentry.io"

# Override the default output format
output_format: |
  # Example:
  # Structure debugging reports as:
  # 1. Issue Summary (one sentence)
  # 2. Steps to Reproduce (numbered)
  # 3. Expected vs Actual Behavior
  # 4. Root Cause Analysis
  # 5. Recommended Fix (with code if applicable)
  # 6. Screenshots/Evidence

# Disable this agent (if not doing frontend work)
disabled: false
# reason: "Backend-only project"
