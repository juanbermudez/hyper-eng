# Framework Docs Researcher Customization
# This agent researches framework documentation and official best practices.
# Customize how framework documentation is researched for your project.

# Add project-specific context for framework research
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - We use Next.js 14 with App Router (not Pages Router)
  # - React 18 with Server Components
  # - Tailwind CSS v3 for styling
  # - Prisma for database ORM
  # - We're on Node.js 20 LTS

# Instructions added BEFORE the default research instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # IMPORTANT: Always check for App Router specific documentation.
  # Pages Router patterns are NOT applicable to our codebase.

# Instructions added AFTER the default research instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # For each framework feature researched:
  # 1. Check if we're using the latest stable API
  # 2. Note any deprecation warnings
  # 3. Check for upcoming changes in the next major version

# Framework versions to target (helps find version-specific docs)
framework_versions:
  # Example:
  # react: "18.2"
  # next: "14.0"
  # typescript: "5.3"
  # tailwindcss: "3.4"
  # prisma: "5.7"

# Preferred documentation sources (Context7 library IDs or URLs)
preferred_sources:
  # Example:
  # - library: "react"
  #   prefer_sections: ["hooks", "server-components"]
  # - library: "nextjs"
  #   prefer_sections: ["app-router", "data-fetching"]
  # - url: "https://ui.shadcn.com/docs"
  #   description: "shadcn/ui component library"

# Documentation sections to skip
skip_sections:
  # Example:
  # - "pages-router"                 # We use App Router only
  # - "class-components"             # We use functional components
  # - "legacy-apis"                  # Not applicable

# Always include these topics in framework research
always_include:
  # Example:
  # - "error-handling"
  # - "performance"
  # - "typescript-integration"

# Override the default output format
output_format: |
  # Example:
  # For each documented pattern:
  # - Include direct links to documentation
  # - Note the documentation version/date
  # - Flag if docs mention deprecation or changes
