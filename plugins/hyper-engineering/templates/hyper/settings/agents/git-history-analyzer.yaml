# Git History Analyzer Customization
# This agent analyzes git history and code evolution patterns.
# Customize how git history analysis is performed for your project.

# Add project-specific context for git history analysis
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - We squash merge all PRs, so look at merge commits for feature history
  # - Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
  # - The repo was migrated from SVN in 2022, history before that is incomplete
  # - Main contributors: @alice (frontend), @bob (backend), @carol (infra)

# Instructions added BEFORE the default analysis instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # When analyzing git history:
  # 1. Focus on commits from the last 6 months (older history less relevant)
  # 2. Pay attention to commits with "BREAKING:" prefix
  # 3. Look for patterns in revert commits to identify problematic areas

# Instructions added AFTER the default analysis instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # Also analyze:
  # - Commit frequency patterns (identify actively maintained vs stale areas)
  # - Common commit authors for specific areas (identify domain experts)
  # - Patterns in bug fix commits (identify fragile areas)

# Time range for analysis
time_range:
  # How far back to analyze (default: 12 months)
  months: 12
  # Focus on commits after this date (optional)
  # after: "2024-01-01"
  # Ignore commits before this date (optional)
  # before: "2025-01-01"

# Branches to analyze
branches:
  # Primary branch to analyze
  primary: "main"
  # Additional branches to include
  include: []
    # Example:
    # - "develop"
    # - "release/*"
  # Branches to exclude
  exclude: []
    # Example:
    # - "dependabot/*"
    # - "renovate/*"

# Paths to focus analysis on
focus_paths:
  # Example:
  # - "src/features/"
  # - "src/components/"
  # - "packages/core/"

# Paths to exclude from analysis
exclude_paths:
  # Example:
  # - "src/legacy/"
  # - "src/generated/"
  # - "*.lock"
  # - "*.snap"

# Commit message patterns to highlight
highlight_patterns:
  # Example:
  # - pattern: "^fix:"
  #   label: "Bug fixes"
  # - pattern: "^feat:"
  #   label: "Features"
  # - pattern: "BREAKING"
  #   label: "Breaking changes"
  # - pattern: "revert"
  #   label: "Reverts"

# Override the default output format
output_format: |
  # Example:
  # Include:
  # - Commit frequency heatmap by directory
  # - Top contributors by area
  # - Recently modified files (last 30 days)
  # - Files with most bug fixes (potential code smell)

# Disable this agent entirely (if git history is not useful)
disabled: false
# reason: "Git history is messy due to migration"
