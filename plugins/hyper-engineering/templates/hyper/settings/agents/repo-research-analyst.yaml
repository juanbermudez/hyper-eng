# Repo Research Analyst Customization
# This agent researches repository structure and conventions.
# Customize how codebase analysis is performed for your project.

# Add project-specific context for repository analysis
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - This is a Next.js 14 app with App Router
  # - We use a feature-based folder structure in src/features/
  # - Shared components are in src/components/ui/
  # - API routes follow REST conventions in src/app/api/

# Instructions added BEFORE the default analysis instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # When analyzing this codebase, pay special attention to:
  # 1. The dependency injection patterns in src/services/
  # 2. The custom hooks in src/hooks/ that wrap external APIs

# Instructions added AFTER the default analysis instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # Also analyze:
  # - Performance patterns (memoization, lazy loading)
  # - Error boundary usage and error handling patterns

# Directories to always include in analysis
include_directories:
  # Example:
  # - src/core/
  # - src/shared/
  # - packages/common/

# Directories to exclude from analysis
exclude_directories:
  # Example:
  # - src/legacy/         # Old code, don't recommend patterns from here
  # - node_modules/
  # - dist/
  # - .next/

# File patterns to focus on
focus_patterns:
  # Example:
  # - "**/*.tsx"          # React components
  # - "**/*.service.ts"   # Service layer
  # - "**/use*.ts"        # Custom hooks

# Override the default output format
output_format: |
  # Example:
  # Include a "Pattern Quality Score" (1-5) for each discovered pattern
  # Flag any anti-patterns found with suggested alternatives
