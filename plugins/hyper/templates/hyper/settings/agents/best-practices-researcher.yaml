# Best Practices Researcher Customization
# This agent gathers external best practices and industry examples.
# Customize how external research is conducted for your project.

# Add project-specific context for best practices research
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - We prioritize accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
  # - Performance budget: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms
  # - We follow the Twelve-Factor App methodology
  # - Security is critical - we handle PII data

# Instructions added BEFORE the default research instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # When researching best practices, prioritize:
  # 1. Enterprise-scale solutions (we have 1M+ users)
  # 2. Solutions with strong TypeScript support
  # 3. Patterns that support incremental adoption

# Instructions added AFTER the default research instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # For each best practice found, also research:
  # - Migration path from our current approach
  # - Potential breaking changes or risks
  # - Adoption rate in the industry

# Authoritative sources to prioritize
prioritize_sources:
  # Example:
  # - "react.dev"                    # Official React docs
  # - "nextjs.org"                   # Official Next.js docs
  # - "web.dev"                      # Google's web best practices
  # - "owasp.org"                    # Security best practices
  # - "patterns.dev"                 # Design patterns

# Sources to avoid or deprioritize
avoid_sources:
  # Example:
  # - "w3schools.com"                # Often outdated
  # - "stackoverflow.com"            # Can be outdated, verify elsewhere

# Topics to always research (in addition to task-specific topics)
always_research:
  # Example:
  # - "accessibility"
  # - "performance optimization"
  # - "security best practices"

# Topics to skip (handled by other processes)
skip_topics:
  # Example:
  # - "deployment"                   # Handled by DevOps team
  # - "infrastructure"               # Handled by platform team

# Override the default output format
output_format: |
  # Example:
  # Rate each best practice by:
  # - Relevance to our stack (high/medium/low)
  # - Implementation effort (easy/medium/hard)
  # - Risk level (low/medium/high)
