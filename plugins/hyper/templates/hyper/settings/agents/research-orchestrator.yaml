# Research Orchestrator Customization
# This agent coordinates parallel research sub-agents and synthesizes findings.
# Customize how research is coordinated for your project.

# Add project-specific context that the orchestrator should know
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - This is a monorepo with multiple packages
  # - Our documentation lives in docs/ and is built with Docusaurus
  # - Legacy code in src/legacy/ should be analyzed but not recommended as patterns

# Instructions added BEFORE the default orchestrator instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # IMPORTANT: Always prioritize security considerations in research synthesis.

# Instructions added AFTER the default orchestrator instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # After synthesizing research, also check for:
  # 1. Related TODOs in the codebase
  # 2. Open GitHub issues on this topic

# Override the default output format for research synthesis
output_format: |
  # Example:
  # Return findings with severity ratings (high/medium/low impact)
  # Include confidence scores for recommendations

# Skip specific sub-agents (remove from parallel research)
# Valid values: repo-research-analyst, best-practices-researcher,
#               framework-docs-researcher, git-history-analyzer
skip_sub_agents: []
  # Example:
  # - git-history-analyzer  # Skip if git history is messy/not useful

# Adjust sub-agent parallelization
parallelization:
  # Maximum concurrent sub-agents (default: 4)
  max_concurrent: 4
  # Timeout per sub-agent in seconds (default: 300)
  timeout_seconds: 300
