# Implementation Orchestrator Customization
# This agent coordinates engineering sub-agents and enforces verification gates.
# Customize how implementation is coordinated for your project.

# Add project-specific context for implementation
context_additions: |
  # Example:
  # - All new code must include JSDoc comments
  # - Use TypeScript strict mode
  # - Components should be functional, not class-based
  # - We use Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting

# Instructions added BEFORE the default orchestrator instructions
instructions_prepend: |
  # Example:
  # CRITICAL: Never modify files in src/core/ without explicit approval.
  # These are shared across multiple products.

# Instructions added AFTER the default orchestrator instructions
instructions_append: |
  # Example:
  # After implementation completes:
  # 1. Ensure all exports are documented in the package index
  # 2. Update the internal changelog if this is a breaking change

# Override verification behavior
verification_overrides:
  # Add additional verification checks
  additional_checks: []
    # Example:
    # - name: "JSDoc Coverage"
    #   command: "npm run check:jsdoc"
    #   required: true
    # - name: "Bundle Size"
    #   command: "npm run check:bundle-size"
    #   required: false

  # Skip certain default checks (use with caution)
  skip_checks: []
    # Example:
    # - e2e  # Skip E2E if not applicable to this change

  # Custom commands to override defaults
  custom_commands:
    # lint: "pnpm lint"
    # typecheck: "pnpm typecheck"
    # test: "pnpm test --coverage"
    # build: "pnpm build"

# Git workflow customization
git_workflow:
  # Branch naming pattern (uses {{PROJECT_SLUG}} and {{TASK_ID}} variables)
  branch_pattern: "feat/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/{{TASK_ID}}"
  # Commit message prefix
  commit_prefix: ""
    # Example: "[{{TASK_ID}}] "

# Browser verification settings (for UI changes)
browser_verification:
  # Enable/disable browser verification phase
  enabled: true
  # Base URL for local development server
  local_url: "http://localhost:3000"
  # Paths to check (relative to local_url)
  check_paths: []
    # Example:
    # - "/"
    # - "/dashboard"
    # - "/settings"
